# xiv_triggernometry

## How to Setup

 1. Navigate to your Triggernometry add-on tab in ACT.
 2. Right-click on **Remote Triggers** and choose **Add**> **Repository** from the list.
 3. Name it whatever you want but put the following in the address:
 ```https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lexxiesia/xiv_triggernometry/master/Triggernometry_Lexxie.xml```
 4. Click **Add** and you're done!
 
 If you don't see **Remote Triggers**, you are running an old version of Triggernometry. Download the latest update from [https://github.com/paissaheavyindustries/Triggernometry/releases/](https://github.com/paissaheavyindustries/Triggernometry/releases/).

## What's in it?
Triggers within the repository are separated by content folders. By default, most stuff are enabled by default. Disable triggers that you don't want activated. That is all!

If there're any problems or issues, hit me up on Discord.
