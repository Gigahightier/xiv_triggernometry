 If you don't see **Remote Triggers**, you are running an old version of Triggernometry. Download the latest update from [https://github.com/paissaheavyindustries/Triggernometry/releases/](https://github.com/paissaheavyindustries/Triggernometry/releases/).

## What's in it?
Triggers within the repository are separated by content folders. Most stuff are enabled by default. Disable triggers that you don't want activated. That is all!
